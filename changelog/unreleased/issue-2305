Enhancement: Add option for skipping rewrite step during prune

We've added the `--skip-rewrite` flag to the `prune` command which
allows the user to skip the rewriting step of the prune command. This
gives the user some control over the read/write activity occurs on the
backend, which is important for those backends with metered transactions.
